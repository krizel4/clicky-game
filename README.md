# Clicky Game

This is a memory game created with React. This was week 19's assignment where we broke the application's UI into components and responded to user events.


## App Functionality

The card pieces are organized in a JSON file and they all start with a "clicked" value of "false". The goal of the game is to hit all the characters once. As soon as a character is hit twice, the game resets. 

## Languages/Dependencies
